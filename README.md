# project1
I use twitters bootstrap to create udacity frontend nanodegree project 1; I changed the lay out of the images; two of them in rows and one column;
I also tried this project without bootstrap using just flexbox; It took a lot of time;
I do not have any projects yet; Therefore I put project 1 in all the links
